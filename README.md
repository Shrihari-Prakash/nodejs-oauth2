## üì¶ Dependencies
Almost everything is **optional** except MongoDB.
| Dependency                  | Optional | Used by Default | Related Options                                                                                            | Disable Recommended? |
| --------------------------- | -------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| MongoDB                     | No       | Yes             | mongo-db.connection-string                                                                                 | No                   |
| Redis                       | Yes      | Yes             | privilege.can-use-cache, redis.\*                                                                          | No                   |
| SendGrid                    | Yes      | Yes             | user.account-creation.require-email-verification (backend & frontend), privilege.can-reset-password (frontend), sendgrid.\* | No                   |
| AWS S3 (or) S3 like storage | Yes      | No              | privilege.can-use-profile-picture-apis, s3.\*                                                              | Yes                  |
| RabbitMQ                    | Yes      | No              | privilege.can-use-push-events, privilege.can-use-rabbitmq, rabbitmq.\*                                     | Yes                  |
> **_NOTE:_** If you don't want a Redis dep, it is possible force the service into using MongoDB as a replacement by changing the option `privilege.can-use-cache` to false. However, disabling this option is highly discouraged since access tokens are deleted (although invalidated) only when the refresh token expires which is typically a really long time. Also using databases for such things might not be a great idea for performance reasons.

The core OAuth logic of Liquid is powered by [node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/node-oauth/node-oauth2-server) from [@node-oauth](https://github.com/node-oauth).
