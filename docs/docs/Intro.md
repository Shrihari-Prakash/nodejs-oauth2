# Liquid
## Seamless and highly customizable authentication and user management server for any project. âœ¨

Liquid is a Docker-based open-source authentication server that supercharges your product development by offering out of the box APIs for features like follow-unfollow, blocking, and banning so that you can focus on just your application logic. ðŸš€

Think of Liquid like integrating a readymade authentication and user management server with your own codebase. You just boot up Liquid in a docker container with a few configuration files and it is all good to go.

For setting up Liquid, refer to the [Setup](/Setup) page.

# Quick Start

:::danger

**You should NEVER use the Quickstart for production deployments. For production usage, please follow the [Setup](/Setup) page and then refer to the [Production Guide](/Making-Liquid-Production-Ready).**

:::

If you're looking for the quickest and most convenient way to run Liquid without installing manually the dependencies for database and cache by yourself, do the following:

1. Run 
```shell
curl -sSL --insecure https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shrihari-prakash/liquid/main/quickstart/docker-compose.yaml > docker-compose.yaml
curl -sSL --insecure https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shrihari-prakash/liquid/main/quickstart/app-config.service.json > app-config.service.json
curl -sSL --insecure https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shrihari-prakash/liquid/main/quickstart/app-config.static.json > app-config.static.json
```
1. In the `app-config.service.json` file, add your frontend origin in `cors.allowed-origins` array (just the origin, not the redirect URI).
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`. 

This is useful if you want to try and evaluate Liquid to see if it fits your needs or to locally develop your apps with Liquid.

## Connecting Your Frontend Application to Liquid Quickstart Instance
For Liquid to securely allow your frontend to authenticate, you will need to add your frontend redirect URI to the trusted list.

### Nitrogen Configuration
1. Login to the [Nitrogen admin panel](http://localhost:2001).
2. Navigate to the `Applications` tab.
3. Click the Edit button.
4. In the redirect URIs section, add your frontend origin.
5. Press Enter.
6. Click Save.

### Test connectivity
1. Navigate to http://localhost:2000?redirect_uri=https://your-frontend.origin
2. Enter the login details and click on Login.
3. You are now navigated back to your application with the state and code parameters in the URL.
4. Refer to [this section](/api-documentation/API-Documentation-OAuth-2.0#access-token-from-authorization-code) to see how to get an access token from the code in URL to call Liquid APIs.

The Quickstart script by default runs in "Demo Mode", which means, an application and a user is already created for you so that you can jump straight into evaluating Liquid with zero configuration. The script also comes with the [Nitrogen admin panel](https://github.com/shrihari-prakash/nitrogen) preconfigured. You can manage users and permissions by navigating to http://localhost:2001.
